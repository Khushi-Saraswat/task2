# Spring Boot JWT Authentication Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement authentication in a Spring Boot application using JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens, MySQL as the database, and the Spring Security framework. It includes functionalities like user registration and login, where users are authenticated with JWT tokens for secure access to protected resources.

## Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure the API with JWT-based authentication.
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register by providing a username and password.
- **User Login**: Authenticate users with credentials and provide a JWT token.
- **MySQL Database**: Stores user details and manages authentication data.
- **Spring Security**: Integrates Spring Security to handle authentication and authorization.
- **REST API**: Exposes a simple REST API for user registration and login.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend application.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for stateless authentication.
- **MySQL**: Relational database to store user credentials.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For interacting with the database.
- **Spring Web**: For building RESTful APIs.



## How JWT Authentication Works
- During login, the server generates a JWT token that contains the userâ€™s information (e.g., username).
- This token is then sent to the client and stored 
- For every subsequent request, the client sends the JWT token in the `Authorization` header, and the server validates it to grant or deny access.

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic example of how to set up JWT-based authentication in a Spring Boot application with MySQL. It can be extended to include more complex features like role-based access control, refresh tokens, etc.
